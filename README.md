# WebDev

WebDev is a set of web pages that provide functionality without the need for extensive external libraries.

## Carousel
Add a set of pictures / texts to the top of your web site, the slides will change in a given interval or when the user either clicks on the next / prev button or one the navigation dots.

Download the js, html and css file and adapt them to your need.


## Docker Compose 
There is also a docker-compose file included, so you can easily test your development if needed with a basic nginx server.
